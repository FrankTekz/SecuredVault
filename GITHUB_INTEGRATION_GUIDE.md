# Using Replit's GitHub Integration

Replit offers a built-in GitHub integration that makes it easy to push your code to GitHub without manual downloading. Here's how to use it:

## Step 1: Access Version Control

Look for the Version Control icon in the left sidebar of your Replit workspace. It looks like a branch icon.

## Step 2: Connect to GitHub

If you haven't connected your GitHub account yet, you'll see a "Connect to GitHub" button. Click it and follow the authorization process.

## Step 3: Create a Repository

After connecting to GitHub:
1. You'll see a form to create a new repository
2. Enter a repository name (e.g., "password-manager")
3. Add an optional description
4. Choose whether to make it public or private
5. Click "Create repository"

## Step 4: Push Your Code

Once the repository is created:
1. You'll see all your files staged for commit
2. Enter a commit message (e.g., "Initial commit")
3. Click "Commit & push"

This will push all your code to the GitHub repository.

## Step 5: Verify on GitHub

After pushing your code:
1. You'll see a confirmation message
2. Click the link to view your repository on GitHub
3. Verify that all your files have been pushed correctly

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:
1. Make sure you have authorized Replit to access your GitHub account
2. Try refreshing the Version Control panel
3. Check that you don't already have a repository with the same name
4. Ensure you have proper permissions for your GitHub account
