# Deployment Guide for Your Password Manager

After successfully pushing your code to GitHub, you have several options for deploying your application. This guide will walk you through the most accessible options.

## Option 1: Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)

Vercel is an excellent platform for deploying React applications with zero configuration.

### Steps:

1. **Create a Vercel Account**
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign up using your GitHub account

2. **Import Your Repository**
   - Once logged in, click "Add New..." → "Project"
   - Find and select your password manager repository
   - Click "Import"

3. **Configure Your Project**
   - Vercel will automatically detect that this is a Vite project
   - Framework Preset: Select "Vite"
   - Build Command: Leave as default (`npm run build`)
   - Output Directory: Leave as default (`dist`)
   - Install Command: Leave as default (`npm install`)
   - Root Directory: Leave as default (`.`)

4. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Wait for the build to complete (usually takes 1-2 minutes)
   - Once deployed, you'll receive a URL to your live application

### Notes for Vercel Deployment:
- Vercel will automatically deploy updates when you push changes to your GitHub repository
- You can add a custom domain in your project settings if desired

## Option 2: Deploy to Netlify

Netlify is another excellent platform for deploying static sites.

### Steps:

1. **Create a Netlify Account**
   - Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) and sign up using your GitHub account

2. **Import Your Repository**
   - Click "Add new site" → "Import an existing project"
   - Select GitHub and authorize Netlify if prompted
   - Select your password manager repository

3. **Configure Your Project**
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Publish Directory: `dist`

4. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy site"
   - Wait for the build to complete
   - Once deployed, you'll receive a URL to your live application

## Option 3: GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is a free hosting service provided by GitHub.

### Steps:

1. **Update `vite.config.ts`**
   - Add base path to match your repository name:
   ```typescript
   export default defineConfig({
     base: '/password-manager/', // Replace with your repo name
     // rest of your config
   });
   ```

2. **Add Deploy Script to `package.json`**
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "deploy": "npm run build && gh-pages -d dist"
   }
   ```

3. **Install `gh-pages` Package**
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev gh-pages
   ```

4. **Deploy**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

5. **Configure GitHub Pages**
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Go to Settings → Pages
   - Select "gh-pages" branch as the source
   - Click "Save"

## Important Notes About Deployment

1. **Client-Side Only Deployment**
   - The current implementation is client-side only with all data stored in localStorage
   - This means you can deploy just the frontend part without a server

2. **Backend Integration**
   - If you later add backend functionality, you'll need to:
     - Set up a server deployment (Heroku, Railway, Render, etc.)
     - Update API endpoints in your frontend code to point to your deployed backend

3. **Environment Variables**
   - For added security, consider using environment variables for sensitive configuration
   - Both Vercel and Netlify support environment variables in their dashboard
